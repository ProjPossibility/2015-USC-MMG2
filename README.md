Welcome to StealthFly Runner
A game of reflex and acquity of hearing.

This app is currently compatible with iOS and Android. To play, please open the project with Unity and build on your desired platform.

This game has graphics, but does not require them to play. The game presents obstacles in the form of changes in pitch. If the pitch rises, the obstacle is on the right. If the pitch drops, the obstacle is on the left.

If you crash into an obstacle, you die.

Why should those with perfect vision have all of the fun? Move over, FlappyBird and TempleRun. StealthFly Runner is here.
